# Shared hostfile

Some discussion on Mastodon, and I thought this might be a good thing to start:  A shared hostfile for people to use, should they desire.

It would, obviously, allow people to still resolve real DNS names.  But, as a promise to the community:  The BuffaloMesh.net nodes under mine own control will honor this hostfile.
